I used Floyd warshal algorithm to find distance between the infected nodes and all the other nodes. Then I created a hashset containing all the nodes And remove those nodes each time whose distance was more than x, and after h operations we were left with a hashset containing only those nodes whose distance to all the infected nodes was less than or equal to x. That's the brief
